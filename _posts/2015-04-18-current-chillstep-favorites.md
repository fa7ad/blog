# I hated dubstep!!!

Yup, I did... Only cuz dubstep automatically translated to Skrillex in most mainstream charts.  
Sonny is great, but after a while the music gets boring...

### Enter Chillstep

Browsing through youtube, I found a subgenre called **Chillstep**. I was like _**WTF is that?!**_  
A few weeks later, I'm still obsessed with this genre.  
It just sounds good, its kinda like the electronic version of relaxing music. But, for some reason it gets me going when I'm working... Kinda like _coffee_

## So, here is my list of favourites _atm_
1. Game of Thrones theme (Dubstep version) by **Rameses B**  
  _I get it, its not exactly chillstep but its not upbeat dubstep either_
2. Gone by **Dezolent & Mona Moua**
3. Superhuman (Culture Code Remix) by **Juventa & Kelly Sweet**
4. Time (Yelhigh! Remix) by **Satellite Empire**
5. Break The Fall (Gemini Remix) by **Laura Welsh**
6. Farewell (Sauniks Remix) by **Spiffy Man & Progley**
7. Hero (New made Edit) by **Pegboard Nerds & Elizaveta**

# That's it! _for now..._

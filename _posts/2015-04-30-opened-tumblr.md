## I joined the land of randomness

For those of you who don't know what tumblr is, tumblr is a _quote-unquote_ "blogging" platform.  
But it isn't **just** that, its where every kind of random things happen.  
Now, some of these "things" are great like designs and themes, others... _like crazy fandoms_ **Not so much**

### So far, I'm liking it

I signed up, installed a theme _(mainly html based)_ and followed a few blogs.  
And so far, I kinda like the platform for its simplicity

### You should try it as well!

Its a great platform to share content and find other content creators, just avoid the weird kids... You'll be fine :)
